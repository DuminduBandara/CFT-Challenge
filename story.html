        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The goal of capture the flag (CTF), a typical outdoor sport in which two or more teams each have a flag (or other markers), is to capture the other team's flag, which is placed at the team's "base," and safely return it to their own base. 
        This CTF box is mainly focus on the new banking employees for cyber security unit and information Security enthusiasts. This is a good opportunity to test their skills like pen-testing and cyber security skills. SpaceX will test your basic computer science skills, logical thinking skills, programming skills and problem-solving skills. 
        In this CTF box every player has to face 20 levels. In each level you have to find a flag in order to go forward in this challenge, you have to submit those flags. Basically, in here we have used some technologies like cryptography, Steganography, basic programming technics as well as some web base activities in order to makes our CTF box more professional. Apart from these techniques we have modern technologies as well.
